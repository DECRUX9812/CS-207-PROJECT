# CS-207-PROJECT


# Introduction
Here we are building a car which can avoing htiing the obstacle and can decide its own path so it know where to go and decided it path by itself.
      This projects is pretty easy to make you just need some parts and the car chassis which i am going to explain in this readme  or can say a kind of small introduction.
Here is the small video which you can refer to what exactly our project is and can have a general idea if u are a already  a computer science student.

# Parts / Hardware

 1> Car chassis
 
  2> Motor shield or dula bridge driver 
 
 3> Car shield if u prefer not using the breadboard 
 
 4> 4 car motors or 2 motors depending on chassis
 
 5> wires to connect the parts 
 
 6> ultasonic sensor 
 
 7> servo motor 
 
 8> aruino uno 
 
 9> usb cable to upload the code
# Build

Then assemble all the parts as respectvely and as you see in video and seclete the best place to put your ultrasonics sensor if you like you could use more than one ultarsnic sensor and code it accordingly and then just upload the code acccordingly so that the pins of the arduino that you are using and set the pins accordingly so that your dual bridge motor run and car move in appropiate direction.
  
# Code 

The coding was pretty simple and easy you just have to take care of the pins and the reading and values that you forward and 
then if you are using the diffrent pins or not using the car shield then you can use your own pins number as you like 
if you are using a breadboard and then the project is ready and great just complete the code and upload and enjoy your car and modify
and play accordingly.

# Future

keep looking as I will be using GPS shield  to modify my car and driving it accordingly and so it will drive at the speed and control speed 
and will go accordingly to Way Point.
